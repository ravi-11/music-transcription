Music Transcription: A 112 Term Project
######################################

[A few notes on design]

At the highest level, this project was supposed to be a sort-of Guitar Hero for actual instruments:
load up a MIDI file, play along with it, and find how good you are at playing the song.

From a practicality and design standpoint, this is really three separate elements: pitch detection,
music representation, and music transcription. If those three things were combined into one "all-or-nothing"
application (the final product), it would be pretty difficult to nail down as the three parts would need 
to work together flawlessly.  To that end, my project is split into three modules: an instrument tuner,
a sheet music transcriber, and a somewhat-working approximation of the original idea.
